#### Learning from images

![Main Page]

How to use:
- Paste a URL to an image, or choose an image from your device by clicking the "Browse..." button
- Sit tight for a few seconds as the data from the image will be processed with Microsoft Cognitive Sciences API and Google Vision API and will use the better of the two results
- Results will be returned in a modal with a statement saying what it believe the image to be

**_(Disclaimer: not all results are correct, I do provide an accuracy score from the API with each result)_**

To develop:
- clone my repo or download zip
- navigate to directory (impression-web)
- start server with `node server.js`
- **no code compilation needed, you don't compile static HTML/CSS/JS lol.**

To contribute: 
- fork my repo
- create a new branch and name it the feature that you are working on
- make changes
- push changes to github
- create a pull request
